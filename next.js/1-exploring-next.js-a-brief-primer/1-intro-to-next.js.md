# intro to next.js

## challenge with react
react runs on the client side (runs on the web browser)
- could negatively affect seo and initial load performance (takes some time to be correctly rendered on screen)
- loading can take up to a few seconds

## the rise of next.js
next.js solves the issues that react has
- pre-renders the app on the server side
    - lets the browser display the rendered react app as plain html, making it interactive as soon as the javascript bundle has been transferred to the client

**innovative features:**
- automatic code splitting
- server-side rendering
- file-based routing systems
- route prefetching
- etc.

next.js allows devs to write reusable code for both client and server sides 

it makes very complex tasks effortless to implement

**new features:**
- static site generation
- incremental static generation
- native typescript support
- automatic polyfills
- image optimization
- support for internationalization
- performance analytics

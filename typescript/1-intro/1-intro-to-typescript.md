# intro to typescript

## what is typescript?
typescript generates javascript

wherever we see use for javascript in the modern world, we can generate this javascript using typescript

**typescript is a superset of javascript**
- it includes all the features of javascript and adds a few additional features

## why we need typescript
as apps become larger and more complex, the flexibility and simplicity of javascript can also present challenges
- typescript adds additional features and benefits on top of javascript that can help devs write maintainable, scalable code more efficiently and address common challenges that arise in large-scale javascript develepment

typescript is a strongly typed, object-oriented language that uses a compiler to generate javascript
- the compiler will identify any errors within the code base even before it is run in an interpreter (making it more reliable at build time than javascript on its own)
